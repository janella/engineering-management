# My engineering manager readme
My thoughts on managing technical people.

## Hi, I'm Janella. I want to help you do the best work of your life.

This is a document that outlines my managerial style, and what I aspire to do for you as your manager. It's a way for me to be transparent to you about my values and my motivations for what I do, and to open feedback lines so I can better advocate for you at Xero. I'm not perfect and I know I can do better - so this entire document is subject to change as I'm exposed to more ideas of what a great manager should be for you.

This is based off of the ideas found in [this blogpost](https://matthewnewkirk.com/2017/09/20/share-your-manager-readme/).

## My role

I'm a grad team lead. This means that I'm responsible for coaching, supporting, and mentoring Xero graduates through our one-year graduate program.

I'm here to:
* Help you explore your options and interests during your four rotations
* Work with you to develop a style of learning that suits you, and that you can use in the future
* Provide you with specific, actionable feedback from your colleagues
* Make sure the Xero grad program attracts and retains great talent (like you!)

That last bit is important - if I'm doing something that makes it hard for me to retain your talent and potential, don't hesitate to tell me.

I'm a developer by trade, so sometimes my technical knowledge won't align with the rotation you're in, but I strive to have great communication lines with your rotation buddy and ensure that you receive relevant, timely feedback.

## My values

I became a manager because I love the idea of growing other people. As an intern, there were a lot of people who I respected and admired that believed in my potential, during a time when I didn't think I was all that much.

I strive to believe in you as much as they believed in me.

I want our relationship to emphasise:
* Empowerment
* Growth
* Trust and transparency
* Experimentation

My people management responsibilities take priority over everything else - my own development work included. If you want to talk to me or have a yarn about anything at all, flick me a message and I will make time.

## Empowerment

You're here because you're smart and capable. I trust you to know your own limits, and to call for support if you need it. I'm here to ensure you have the skills, space and support you need to do a good job and to take ownership of your technical work and your career.

If at any point, you feel as though you are struggling to do your job or feel disempowered in some way, please don't hesitate to raise it with me. I'm here to advocate for you and your career development.

## Growth

There are two parts to growth as a grad at Xero: learning and feedback.

### Learning
Learning is a bit funny in the grad year. Because of the rotations and the exposure you get to the different disciplines, it's hard to know what you might value or aspire to do in a few months time. It's also a big shock to the system (and to the ego!) every time you start a new rotation and get put back to square one.

I aim to work with you to set clear and achievable expectations for your career growth and learning. These expectations can be over your grad year, and also within the three-month rotations that aim to give you a solid idea of what that discipline or team entails. But the most valuable thing to grow overall is learning how _you_ learn on the job - and you'll get loads of practice with that every time you start a rotation.

While ultimately the responsibility for your personal development lies with you, I'm always available if you need someone to bounce ideas off of.

### Feedback
The other half of growth here is feedback. I aim to give you continual feedback over your grad year. While the nature of the grad team lead role is that I don't work directly with you in a team, I aim to give you feedback on how you're doing as soon as I hear it. I want to tell you when you've done something awesome that your team has noticed. I also want to tell you if there's something that I believe you could do better next time.

## Trust and transparency

I want to understand your motivators and empathise with how you want to do work. I believe every developer and engineer is different, and I strive to mould our managerial relationship into one that works best for the both of us. I'm here to make sure Xero is a safe place for you to work, and that your physical and mental wellbeing is kept as a priority here.

I also believe in making sure our lines of communication are as transparent and as upfront and honest as possible. I want to hear your honest opinion about our relationship and if you think I can improve in something, and I want to be able to give you my honest feedback also. Please feel free to be frank with me.

## Experimentation

I value trying new things when managing someone. This may very well be your first experience with a formal technical manager. I'm prone to tossing ideas or suggestions out there and I don't expect all of them to stick, so don't hesitate to be a bit wild or wacky with something you want to try in terms of your career or your style of learning. I would absolutely love to try a style of management that I haven't tried before with a grad!

## I'm still learning too!

I'm still in the early days of my career and my line management experience. I've been a developer for seven years, and a people manager with the grad program for two years. I still have so much to learn about managing people and creating great software. I've made a lot of mistakes, but I always strive to get better.

One of the best ways to know if I'm doing my job okay is through feedback from you. Please feel free to give me feedback on my management approach during our 1:1s, through Slack, email, or via my manager - whatever you're comfortable with.

## After your grad year

You'll be transferred to your new team's people lead at the end of the grad year. I'm a giant sap so it's always a bittersweet time for me, but I know you'll do well! I'm still around of course, so if you ever want to have a chat over a coffee or a scone, flick me a message. I would love to hear how you're doing.

Thanks for reading this! I'm looking forward to working with you. :)

Janella
