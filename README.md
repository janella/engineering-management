# My engineering manager readme
Thoughts on managing technical people.

## Hi, I'm Janella. I want to help you do the best work of your life.

This is a document that outlines my managerial style, and what I aspire to do for you as your manager. It's a way for me to be transparent to you about my values and my motivations for what I do, and to open feedback lines so I can better advocate for you at Xero. I'm not perfect and I know I can do better - so this entire document is subject to change as I'm exposed to more ideas of what a great manager should be for you.

This is based off of the ideas found in [this blogpost](https://matthewnewkirk.com/2017/09/20/share-your-manager-readme/).

## My role

I'm a team lead for 8bit Engineering, which is part of the Platform Engineering team at Xero. This means that I'm accountable for making 8bit a great place for your professional development, where we deliver great solutions for our client teams. I also want to make sure it's a fun and interesting team to be a part of.

I'm a developer by trade, but I accept that early on as a team lead, I won't be doing much hands-on development.

## My values

I want our relationship to emphasise:
* Empowerment
* Trust and transparency
* Experimentation

My people management responsibilities take priority over everything else. If you want to talk to me or discuss a matter, flick me a message and I will make time.

## Empowerment

I trust you to know your own limits, and expect and encourage you to call for support if you need it. What I want to ensure is that you have the skills, space, and support you need to do a good job and to take ownership of your technical work and your career.

While ultimately the responsibility for your personal development lies with you, I'm always available if you need someone to bounce ideas off of. I expect you to tell me the things you want to do or achieve, and I'll do my best to help you find that opportunity.

## Trust and transparency

I want to understand your motivators and empathise with them. I'm here to make sure Xero is a safe place for you to work and express your opinions, and that your physical and mental wellbeing is seen as a priority. 

My expectation is that our lines of communication are as transparent, as upfront, and as honest as possible. I want to hear your opinion about our relationship and our team, and if you think I can improve in something, and I want to be able to give you my honest feedback also. Please feel free to be frank with me. I aim to give you feedback on how you're doing as soon as I hear it. I want to tell you when you've done something awesome that your team has noticed. I also want to tell you if there's something that I believe you could do better next time.

## Experimentation

I value trying new things as a team lead and as a manager. I'm prone to tossing ideas or suggestions out there and I don't expect all of them to stick, so don't hesitate to be a bit wild or wacky with something you want to try in terms of your career or the team.

The other half of this is ensuring that the environment in the team feels safe enough to try these experiments - whether it's related to technical, communications, process, or teamwork aspects. I'm relying on you and others in the team to be comfortable with change and just giving things a go, and raising if something threatens that sense of safety.

## I need your help

I'm still in the early days of my career and my line management experience. I've been a developer for eight years, a people manager with the grad program for two years, and a team lead for less than that. I still have so much to learn about managing people and creating great software. I've made a lot of mistakes, but I always strive to get better.

One of the best ways to know if I'm doing my job okay is through feedback from you. Please feel free to give me feedback on my management approach during our 1:1s, through Slack, email, or via my manager - whatever you're comfortable with.

Thanks for reading this! I'm looking forward to working with you. :)

Janella
