# My engineering manager readme
Thoughts on managing technical people.

## Hi, I'm Janella.

This is a document about my managerial style, and what I want to do for you as a manager. It's a way for me to be transparent to you about my values and my motivations, and to open feedback lines so I can better advocate for you at Xero.

This is based off of the ideas found in [this blogpost](https://matthewnewkirk.com/2017/09/20/share-your-manager-readme/).

## My role

I'm a team lead for 8bit Engineering, which is part of the Platform Engineering team at Xero. This means that I'm accountable for making 8bit a great place for your professional development, where we deliver great solutions for our client teams. I also want to make sure it's a fun and interesting team to be a part of.

I'm a developer by trade, but I accept that early on as a team lead, I won't be doing much hands-on development. I don't want to lose it completely though - I feel it's important for me to stay empathetic about what life as an engineer is like at Xero.

## My values

I want our relationship to emphasise:
* Empowerment
* Trust and transparency
* Experimentation

My people management responsibilities take priority over everything else. If you want to talk to me or discuss a matter, flick me a message and I will make time.

## Empowerment

I trust you to know your own limits, and expect and encourage you to call for support if you need it. What I want to ensure is that you have the skills, space, and support you need to do a good job and to take ownership of your technical work and your career.

While ultimately the responsibility for your personal development lies with you, I'm always available if you need someone to bounce ideas off of. I expect you to tell me the things you want to do or achieve, and I'll do my best to help you find that opportunity.

## Trust and transparency

I want to understand your motivators and empathise with them. I'm here to make sure Xero is a safe place for you to work and express your opinions, and that your physical and mental wellbeing is seen as a priority. 

My expectation is that our lines of communication are as transparent, as upfront, and as honest as possible. I want to hear your opinion about our relationship and our team, and if you think I can improve in something, and I want to be able to give you my honest feedback also. Be frank with me. 

I aim to give you feedback on how you're doing as soon as I hear it. I want to tell you when you've done something awesome that your team has noticed. I also want to tell you if there's something that I believe you could do better next time.

## Experimentation

I value trying new things as a team lead and as a manager. I'm prone to tossing ideas or suggestions out there and I don't expect all of them to stick, so don't hesitate to be a bit wild or wacky with something you want to try in terms of your career or the team.

The other half of this is ensuring that the environment in the team feels safe enough to try these experiments - whether it's related to technical, communications, process, or teamwork aspects. I'm relying on you and others in the team to be comfortable with change and just giving things a go, and raising if something threatens that sense of safety.

## Our 1:1s

I see it as an opportunity to talk about your job and your career, and any goals you may have. I don't often expect them to be about your day-to-day work.

I expect buy-in around a few different things:
* Spend some time preparing before we meet. 10 mins reflecting on how the last few weeks went, or thinking about things you found challenging/interesting, can go a long way.
* You have a plan for your career and development at Xero, and are taking time to work on it. If you can't, then we can talk about why that is.
* That both of us agree to let each other know if we feel expectations are not being met

Julia Evans's zine, [_Help! I have a manager!_](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/22/new-zine--help--i-have-a-manager/), is a solid resource to get some ideas on how to utilise me in a more effective way.

I have a default 1:1 frequency of two weeks, but we can work out what works for you.

I believe in bringing in the philosophy of agile/continuous improvement into a professional development setting, and often encourage people to just try something and re-evaluate in a week or so. Iteration is not just for software - it can be applied to personal growth as well.

## Continuous growth

I'm still in the early days of my career and my line management experience. I've been a developer for eight years, a people manager with the grad program for two years, and a team lead for less than that. I still have so much to learn about managing people and creating great software. I've made a lot of mistakes, but I always strive to get better.

One of the best ways to know if I'm doing my job okay is through feedback from you. Please feel free to give me feedback on my management approach during our 1:1s, through Slack, email, or via my manager - whatever you're comfortable with.

Thanks for reading this! I'm looking forward to working with you. :)

Janella
